Understanding the atmosphere and taking steps to protect it is crucial for the well-being of our planet and future generations.\n",
      " title: Composition and Layers of the Atmosphere:\n",
      " text: The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that envelops the Earth. It is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), along with trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and noble gases. The atmosphere is divided into distinct layers—troposphere, stratosphere,\n",

      " text: The atmosphere acts as a natural shield, regulating the Earth's temperature through the greenhouse effect. Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat and prevent it from escaping into space. This natural phenomenon is essential for maintaining a stable climate. However, human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have intensified the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.\n",
      " title: Ozone Layer Depletion:\n",
      " text: The ozone layer, located in the stratosphere, plays a critical role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. However, human-made substances known as ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), have contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer. This has led to the formation of the ozone hole, particularly over Antarctica, exposing life on Earth to increased UV radiation and its associated risks.\n",

      " text: Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science— and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or Al—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.\n",
      " text: NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.\n",
      " title: Speech recognition\n",
      " text: also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data. Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions. What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.\n",
      " title: Part of speech tagging\n",
      " text: also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and asa noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’\n",

      " title: Named entity recognition, or NEM\n",
      " text: identifies words or phrases as useful entities. NEM identifies ‘Kentucky’ as a location or ‘Fred’ as a man's name. Co-reference resolution is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity. The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (e.g., ‘she’ = ‘Mary’), but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or an idiom in the text (e.g., an instance in which 'bear' isn't an animal but a large hairy person).Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities—attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion—from text. Natural language generation is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it's the task of putting structured information into human language.\n"
